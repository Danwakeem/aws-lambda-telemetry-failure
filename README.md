# AWS Lambda Telemetry Failure

This repo is meant to recreate an issue with the AWS Lambda Telemetry API that we are experiencing

## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
$ yarn deploy
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```bash
yarn sls invoke --function testFunction
```

Which should print out the logs from the last invocation.

Any log line that begins with `‚ö°Ô∏è TELEMETRY: ` is data that this telemetry extension received.

Currently this is all the data the telemetry server will receive üëá

```
‚ö°Ô∏è TELEMETRY: [{"time":"2023-02-10T20:39:01.267Z","type":"platform.initStart","record":{"initializationType":"on-demand","phase":"init","runtimeVersion":"nodejs:18.v4","runtimeVersionArn":"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1::runtime:f2af14107aa47577b6391cef2e58e6032a5520042f7d27a21ab33c9ee5a18adb"}},{"time":"2023-02-10T20:39:01.405Z","type":"platform.telemetrySubscription","record":{"name":"index.js","state":"Subscribed","types":["platform","function"]}}]

```

That last `function` log is also only sent intermittently which is also frustrating.
